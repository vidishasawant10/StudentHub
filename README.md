# Student Hub
# Introduction to User Experience Project
For international students, moving to a foreign country and starting over is never easy. Everything in the application is conceptualized and included based on our individual experiences and feedback from those on a similar path. This is how we can support current students and assist them in their education while fostering a sense of community.

# Mission
We want this web application to be agnoistic and one stop solution that caters to all the needs and requirements of International students.
